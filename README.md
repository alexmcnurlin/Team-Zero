## Download
In a terminal with git installed run one of the following

    * This will use https, so you will have to re-enter you git password whenever you push
* `git clone git@github.com:alexmcnurlin/Team-Zero.git`
    * This uses SSH, you won't need a password, but you'll need to [add your ssh key to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)
